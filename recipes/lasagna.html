    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Hawaiian pizza is a pizza originating in Canada, traditionally topped with pineapple, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and either ham or bacon.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Pineapple</li>
        <li>Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Mozarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) with a rack in the lower position. Oil a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook, flipping occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Pour out pan drippings without wiping pan clean, and return skillet to heat. Add pineapple, cook until lightly browned and caramelized, 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan. Chop bacon and cut pineapple rings into 3/4-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch circle and place on the oiled baking sheet. Prick dough with a fork several times to reduce air bubbles. Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around edges. Sprinkle with cheese, red onion, Canadian bacon, chopped pineapple, and chopped bacon.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, toppings are lightly charred, and crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
